    "Your goal in this assignment: find the attributes of the best & worst coffee shops in the dataset. The text is fairly raw: dates in the review, extra words in the `star_rating` column, etc. You'll probably want to clean that stuff up for a better analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze the corpus of text using text visualizations of token frequency. Try cleaning the data as much as possible. Try the following techniques: \n",
    "- Lemmatization\n",
    "- Custom stopword removal\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind the attributes of good tokens. Once you have a solid baseline, layer in the star rating in your visualization(s). Key part of this assignment - produce a write-up of the attributes of the best and worst coffee shops. Based on your analysis, what makes the best the best and the worst the worst. Use graphs and numbesr from your analysis to support your conclusions. There should be plenty of markdown cells! :coffee:"

       " 10/7/2016 Love the Factory. Good coffee, tasty chicken and waffles and awesome atmosphere. Definitely recommend the Nutella waffle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0.000525\n",
       " 11/25/2016 Very cool decor! Good drinks Nice seating  However...  Just about everything is overpriced. $1.50 extra for 3 ounces of Almond Milk in a cortado. No WiFi Music is a bit loud and the mix is odd.  Pleasant French oldies followed by loud techno. Several tables were dirty when we got there. Service is average.  It feels like a Los Angeles coffee shot that is out of place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           0.000525\n",
       " 11/2/2016 Interesting new coffee place with a vibe that blends posh, hipster, and comfy.  Medium roasted beans have a milder, sweeter flavor than your typical Starbucks espresso shot, so be aware that the coffee tastes less bitter but packs more of a caffeine punch!  This place has homemade pop tarts!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0.000525\n",
       " 12/3/2016 1 check-in They are located within the Northcross mall shopping center facing east toward Burnet Rd with plenty of parking. I loved their computerized user friendly ordering system, it made it easy me to pick & choose all the items I wanted to try. I ordered pop tart, chicken & waffles, strawberry waffles (photos uploaded). This place is ideal for ordering a few dishes to share with your group. Seating is limited since this place is fairly new with lots of visitors. Arrive early and be prepared to wait a bit if you with a large grop.

       " 10/25/2016 1 check-in Check out this video for a review! youtube.com/watch?v=N8Ki…  Cool new place in Austin! It's always great to see places doing something new and unique. The seating arrangements and atmosphere are definitely fun. One thing is that there's no internet, so don't plan on coming here to get stuff done!  You get to order on an ipad! yay.  Pros: - the drink choices are really great. You can get something that you want. You can even get beer here. - great for pictures and enjoying some time off. Sit on a swing ... while playing chase. - parking is plentiful in the plaza area. - friendly baristas  Cons: - food menu isn't too big, but that's okay. Not gluten free for the wife. - very pricey. If you need a place to come on a weekly basis, you're going to need to be a balla.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0.000525\n",

       " 11/16/2016 The greeting of an atmosphere it feels I created. This place speaks to my free spirited soul, with matcha lattes, swings inside that still fit in, pillows, and waffles. This might be the next artist home where computers aren't encouraged by the architecture, but books, talking and chess are.

       " 10/16/2016 My only complaint and desire and heart wish is for this place to be open longer and to allow for Wifi. This place makes my heart happy, it motivates me to study because I want to come here, and it makes me wish I had time to settle and read a wonderful book. The atmosphere is PERFECT, the workers are GENEROUS AND KIND, it's a beautiful place to be.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0.000525\n",
       " 10/12/2016 1 check-in Checked out The Factory this past Sunday with my husband. We wanted to try their delicious looking waffles and were definitely not disappointed.  Husband ordered an iced coffee drink that was delicious, but it wasn't as good as my Golden Age of Milk Tea, well worth the 10 minute wait for the tea to steep.  We both ordered the Nutella Waffle and it was perfect. From the wood plate with the AMAZING paper liner printed with a famous person and an inspirational quote from them. I wanted just the paper because it was so cute and well done. The waffle is basically half a waffle, spread with Nutella and a layer of bananas, then folded in half. While small, it was a perfect amount, the bananas balancing out the sweetness of the Nutella. The waffle itself was crisp perfection, providing a crunch to the meal. The menu is very limited: there was the nutella waffle and a fried chicken waffle. I'm hoping they'll eventually serve other waffles, but totally respect their decision to start small.  The space is gorgeous. From the swings to the mural above the bar, everything looks meticulously planned out. And here is where my biggest advice comes: this place is really not for kids. The way the seating is set up is really for larger people and there is definitely no place for high chairs. While there is giant magnetic poetry on one of the columns, a crazy chair outside and a couple of table games, the giant chess set looks risky for grabby kids. If you have a well-behaved child who can handle it, I would think its fine. However, I watched several families come in and either leave or order to go, commenting it wasn't the best space for them. While this doesn't bother me (I love kidless spaces), it might be jarring to someone expecting to have brunch with the family.  I am so excited to become a regular here! Great new spot!     0.000525\n",

       " 10/15/2016 This place is really nice. They have done a great job... It's the type of place that you could spend hours in. They have a small menu right now, but their drinks, waffles, and pastries are really well made. We'll definitely be coming back soon.... like tomorrow.

       " 10/25/2016 1 check-in Ok, let's try this approach...  Pros: Music Seating Decor General ambiance Service  Cons: iPad ordering (I'm a crotchety old man, kids) Limited coffee menu, or menu in general Relatively expensive Food is pretty but lackluster  I'm still sitting here as I type this and I'm less than overjoyed with the experience, sadly. The space and vibe are great but not quite familiar or intimate enough to beat out a place like Genuine Joe down the street. It seems like they bank on the vibe, and fall short the rest of the way. (This would be a great hangout for the artsy/design crowd having a collaborative meeting.)  The staff is great but the iPad ordering system limits your required interaction with them. They take pride in no wifi to increase interaction but then use iPads instead of people?  Seating is ample, if cramped in a surprisingly large space.  But the food, kids. So pretty, but again lackluster. I tried the Pop+art ($5) and the Nutella Waffle ($4.75) and they both sit on their respective tiny awkward plates half eaten. (Yes the plate liners are cute) The waffle is a great idea but the waffle itself  has no flavor and there's no delight. The tart is similar - the pastry crust is much too thick compared to the Smuckers jam tasting filling and it is essentially just pure sugar. The pastry itself doesn't even taste buttery or crisp. Meh. There appears to be no soul in this confectionary.  Coffee- passable. But at $4 for a cortado and a $1.50 up-charge for almond milk- I'll pick another place.  I get why the reviews are so good here, but there are much better places nearby for that \"cafe with a soul\" feel. This feels like an ACL pop-up. Going for that?  Great, come here.

       " 11/17/2016 1 check-in Listed in 2016 - The Third Time is a Charm! The Factory has A+ decor and a very innovative interactionless (tablet) ordering system. This allows you to look up what to get without feeling pressured by a barista staring at you waiting for you to order. The eclectic selection of tables, couches, and swings (?!) inside with a small kiddy corner appeal to many different types of tastes. This is seriously a cool place to hang out.  However, when it comes to the coffee and food, it's rather not cheap. The waffles range from $4-$8, and coffee is between $3.50 and $5. The quality of the coffee is not yet up to par with other coffee mainstays in Austin, so I would probably not choose to come here just for coffee. However, it is a CUTE date place and I know that M and I will probably come back to chat, people-watch, or read books.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0.000525\n",
       " 11/21/2016 1 check-in This place is fantastic! Ideal place for grabbing a frothy matcha latte and a chicken & waffle. A bit different in the way that you order. Definitely a nice hang-out for millenials or anyone who works in the area and is on a lunch break. Wifi is within reach but they don't have it themselves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0.000525\n",
       " 12/5/2016 This is such a cute little cafe! I've driven by this place many times and hadn't noticed it until today. Glad I stopped-the famous chicken waffle was delish!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 0.000525\n",
       " 10/25/2016 Tried this new cafe spot on Burnet with a friend - unassuming storefront, the decor is quaint af and you have to order from iPads at the counter and then choose a place to sit.  Not a brunch spot as we had thought, just a cafe with a couple of food options. The Nutella waffles we got were on point - there's also a chicken option.  The cold brew coffee was fantastic and my friend's milk tea turned out great too.  Good spot for conversations. Only knocking down a star for the limited options. I hope they add more items to the menu! Milk tea - humongous!! Nutella banana waffles Love the illustrations!

       " 10/19/2016 The matcha lattes are amazing! Great atmosphere, great food and drink, and everything is plated beautifully.

       " 11/2/2016 2 check-ins Love this place!  5 stars for cleanliness 5 stars for fun ambiance/ open space 5 stars for ample seating and comfort 5 stars for convenient parking 5 stars for attentive employees and fast service  I am definitely a fan Cafe w/ a Soul. I finally found a coffee shop I can study at without sacrificing comfort (Starbucks' uncomfortable chairs). The coffee shop endorses social connection, hence, wifi  isn't available. It makes me really happy that a lot of students hang out here with their book bags and laptops and we can all just study in peace and somehow quiet (the background music can get pretty loud). Unfortunately, there will always be that kid who's obnoxiously loud and would like the whole world to know her business. Seriously, unless it's something intriguing or educational, no one cares. In addition, as much \"fun\" as this place looks, it's not child friendly. So parents, make sure your children do not hit the table in front of it and knock out the chess set. Lastly, the sex images in the bathrooms are definitely not appropriate for children.  The ambiance is very much like Austin-- very eccentric and hip! Food and drink presentations are on par. Drink prices are reasonable and similar to good ole Starbucks. But unlike you're typical coffee shop, they have real food such as chicken and waffles.  My favorite about this place is the cleanliness. The employees do a good job maintaining the place. Also, as I watch them make coffees, they do it with fines as if they're creating some type of art, it's pretty cool (in my opinion).  In conclusion, Cafe w/ a Soul is probably the best coffee shop I've ever been to. It's like studying in my own home but away from distractions. I'm awake!

       " 11/20/2016 The store has A+ decoration, but honestly, the coffee it made is not as good as other coffee shop in the surrounding area. It has no wifi, so good for hang out with friend or read a book. Not sure why there is no restroom here. Ordering app is well made, but probably won't be my coffee stop because of the quality of food/coffee. It's selling you the atmosphere they created, so don't expected the food/coffee. Probably would be a good date spot. 8 dollar tiny chicken and waffle. One of the most expensive chicken and waffle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0.000525\n",

       " 10/10/2016 This place is so cute. New favorite coffee spot on Burnet/in Northcross. Almost wish I was still in grad school,  so I would have an excuse to be there everyday.  Amazing coffee and best chicken & waffles ever! The chicken was seasoned perfectly and made for a delicious savory brunch (with the house made slaw they give you on the side). The olive oil cake was also awesome, light and sweet. Perfect coffee companion. My husband and I will definitely be back, as we loved everything and felt it was all very reasonable priced. Olive oil cake, chicken & waffle and 15-minutes-of-fame coffee! So good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0.000525\n",
       " 10/27/2016 2 check-ins Listed in \"Nuptial Coffee Bliss!\", Anderson Lane is the new Black Oh hey, the pro vs con format. I've never used that before. Let's try it:  Pros: 1. This place is cooler than I thought. 2. It's open until 2am. No, really. 3. They have beer & wine. I didn't know that until I saw the beer taps. They offered me a sample.  Cons: 1. If you have to describe The Factory with one word, it probably won't be \"inexpensive.\"  I don't think they're shooting for the \"Sixth Coffeehouse on Anderson Lane but with Flash\" title here, I think they really want to be the official bistro in the neighborhood - far more casual than Bartlett or Hopdoddy, but with a lot more flair than Tea Haus or Starbuck Evenings. Staying open until 2am is a good start, and let's see if they add more to the menu. Remember, no one thought that gentrified Walmart would do well either.  In the meantime, have fun with those chicken & waffles, and their colorful matcha-infused coffees. I'm only interested in straight black, and their pourover Stumptown is great stuff. Try the $5 pop tart at least once, mainly because you can. And then let's meet back here in a couple of weeks, just to see what's been tweaked. This place defines hipster man-cave. I liked the long table with 1/2 bar chairs & stools, & the cool plates & cups. There's a $5 pop tart.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        0.000525\n",
       " 11/10/2016 3 check-ins This place has been shown on my social media for days so i finally visited! One of THE cutest and artistic looking coffeeshops I have ever visited. You can self order which is nice because you can take your time and look at the pictures to help you decide! I especially liked how pictures were shown so I knew which coffee/tea came out aesthetically  I ordered the famous matcha green latte and i dont usually drink coffee but it went beyond my expectations. They give you a good amount and its creamy and sweet. Only downside is no wifi.. So hard to study here.

       " 11/25/2016 1 check-in Love love loved the atmosphere! Every corner of the coffee shop had its own style, and there were swings!!! I ordered the matcha latte, and it was muy fantastico! Ordering and getting my drink were pretty streamlined. I ordered on an iPad, which included all beverage selections that ranged from coffee to wine, desired level of sweetness, and a checkout system. I got my latte within minutes!  I was hoping for a typical heart or feather on my latte, but found myself listing out all the possibilities of what the art may be. Any ideas?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0.000525\n",
       " 11/10/2016 7 check-ins The Factory Cafe is overall such a beautiful and really cool place to just hang out with friends or work on homework. You'll probably see the people around you taking the time to perfect their aesthetic Instagram pictures and Snapchat stories (myself included). Although the cafe itself doesn't provide wifi, it's within range of other places with wifi so that shouldn't deter you from going! This place looks like it literally came straight off of Pinterest! So cute!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0.000525\n",
       " 11/30/2016 1 check-in Listed in Brunch Spots I loved the eclectic and homey plush decor and who doesn't want to swing and drink their coffee?  I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make brunch so we headed out in search of chicken and waffles.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seat and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold brew coffee, chicken and waffles and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The chicken and waffles wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the waffle was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.  A great place to be cozy and chat with your friends, a date or read a book.

       " 10/13/2016 1 check-in I really enjoyed my visit here. I ordered the cortado and chicken waffle. Both were excellent.  The space is very Instagram worthy.  Awesome mural. Staff was very friendly too and I loved the iPad ordering system. Chicken waffle and cortado paired with sparkling water to cleanse the palate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0.000525\n",
       " 12/2/2016 What a fantastic atmosphere. I dropped in to catch up on some work and found a fantastic atmosphere and a great staff. I wish I could work here every day. I had the Darling pour-over and olive bread, and camped out near the pop-art fabric fire in the fireplace nook. Wallace (owner) and his team were spot-on with service and help. Full disclosure: The place is so beautiful on the inside that I Instagrammed it - couldn't help it, I claimed it for my own, like dozens of other folks. Highly recommended, so get here when you can!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.000525\n",
       " 10/7/2016 1 check-in Came in on the first day of opening, hours currently 6am-2pm. At some point they'll stay open till 12 midnight. I think this might be the most beautiful cafe in Austin, the interior is charming, snazzy, cozy. There's even a pair of swings to sit on while you enjoy your coffee and play a game of chess. I ordered the Marymint Monroe, basically a mint mojito. It's been a while since I've been to Philz coffee so it's hard to compare, but I think the Marymint is a little creamier. Also had the banana nutella waffle, bananas and nutella are always a winning combination, can't go wrong there. No wifi yet but I'm sure it will come soon. Friendly staff, delicious offerings, antique filament lightbulbs and best of all, Bieber and MJ high above on a mural watching over you. This place is aces.

       " 11/21/2016 This spot is super cute (\"like eating in a Pottery Barn\"), with drinks that are unique and with a somewhat limited menu. We tried the chicken and waffles, which was surprisingly delicious and our drinks were also tasty. I had the Livin La Vida Mocha and my husband had the pour over. I will definitely return with company, but prices weren't good enough to make this a regular stop in our rotation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0.000525\n",

       " 12/2/2016 Okay, so after visiting my friends in LA and trying a mint mojito iced coffee, I had to find one in Austin that's comparable. It was getting very difficult to find one to begin with, let alone a good one. I saw the mint coffee on the factory's website and had to try it. Unfortunately I was shell-shocked at the price tag ($7 if I remember correctly??)  I figured it would be a large drink and particularly fabulous and hopefully large to make up for the over the top price (this is $3 more than philz)   Was it particularly fabulous? No. It was good, it wasn't as good as philz. Was it bigger?? No. It was about 4 ounces of  coffee, tops. Will I be back? Absolutely not, especially considering I can get a 20 oz mint mojito coffee from tea haus for $3 less that tastes just as good.  This place is also self service (for ordering and pick up), why that would lead to inflated prices and not a price decrease is far beyond my understanding. I don't recommend it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.000525\n",
       " 10/15/2016 1 check-in Note: Do not come here if you're looking for a place to work remotely! There is no WiFi and no outlets. Staff says they are hoping to create an environment where people socialize and enjoy each other's company rather than being on their phones.  For a spot to catch up with friends over coffee and pastries, I highly recommend coming here! There is ample seating, an open layout, and a lot to look at  and talk about including wooden swings, books and a chess board on a table, and a cute corner of pillows in another corner.  They serve coffee drinks, waffles, and pastries. The pop tart was extremely sweet, so much so that I was unable to finish even half. Their cortado was pretty good. The food and drinks are quite pricey here, which makes me question returning.  Presentation and ambience wise, I give this place 5 stars! But price and food, probably a 3.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0.000525\n",
       " 10/29/2016 First time checking this place out first time. Pretty swag. Nice assortment of drinks. I got the 15 minutes of fame. Also got the poptart. Delicious!

       " 11/9/2016 Really cute and heavily hipster atmosphere. We tried this place late night on Saturday and enjoyed the first visit. You will want to try their swing for sure. Seating space is somewhat limited and no wifi is available, so be aware. This is more like a place for you to enjoy its atmosphere. Drinks were good, though make sure you have enough in your bank account because their drinks are probably not for broke college students.

       " 11/11/2016 I never write Yelp reviews, ever. But when I walked in here it felt like I was in a hipster Alice in wonderland. The decor is spot on and they left no details out.

       " 10/28/2016 AMAZING atmosphere! I walked around for 5 minutes looking at everything before even ordering.  Most unique take on chicken and waffles I've ever had. Hands down best night time hangout in North Austin. P.S.... their Matcha Latte is to die for!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0.000525\n",
       " 11/22/2016 Cute, eclectic furniture and lots of things to do! Gorgeous seating vignettes, lots of space, classy decor. Only thing to watch out for--no wifi...not really a place to do work or study, but great place to chill!

       " 11/9/2016 1 check-in Listed in In Search of Fantastic Coffee So, I really didn't want to write this review. I didn't want to tell anyone how awesome The Factory - Cafe With a Soul is because I don't want it overrun and super busy with no place to sit like so many other decent coffee shops in Austin. I happened to come in here with a friend mid-week and we sat here for several hours, enjoying the peace and quiet, the atmosphere, and the awesome coffee.  This place is a little eclectic - lots of peculiar art, books, games, knick-knacks, and an almost head-scratching drink and food menu. Waffles and pop tarts...and beer? And... coffee mojitos? Well, it works. Whatever is going on here, it works fabulously. They serve Stumptown Coffee, which as someone from the Northwest, I totally appreciate. They also brew coffee correctly. There is not a hint of bitterness or overcooked milk going on here. The iPad ordering screens are mostly cool, (although they need more options for customization) and the million different types of seating, (couches, pillows, swings, big chairs, little chairs, bar seating, regular tables) is both delightful and refreshing. The baristas make foam art - something that I have only seen at Houndstooth here in Austin. Hanging out here was a wonderful experience - this is a five star establishment, the best coffee house I've been to in Austin, and I will be back - time and time again. Double espresso with tonic water. Beautiful Macha A beary lovely mocha!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0.000525\n",
       " 12/2/2016 A cafe that doesn't have Wifi but makes you order from an iPad. Seriously? $2 extra for almond milk?! The latte was already $5 for 12 oz. Don't expect to have a lot of Vegan customers. There's a serious lack of customer service for the  overpriced food and beverages.  You order from an iPad, and they call out your drink. There is no interaction between the customer and employee, and they still expect a tip? This cafe also advertises that they have games. There are two games, chess and tick tax toe. It is a beautiful cafe, with very cool furnishings. However I wont be going back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0.000525\n",
       " 10/9/2016 1 check-in I am very impressed with this place. The food portions were so perfect and not mention delicious! The waffle architects (staff) were all so accommodating and nice. We were able to talk to one of the owners for a bit and he was very helpful with his recommendations and accurate. I highly recommend this place. I will definitely be coming back when I am in Austin again. Nutella and Banana waffles. Chicken and Waffles, Olive Oil Pound Cake, and Milk Tea!

       " 11/20/2016 This is a tough one for me.  I took my children here as a treat one afternoon and our first impression was good.  I liked the decor and the place has swings and a chess set!  Score for the kids! I went to place my order and had to use an ipad.  It was DIY-ordering.  I hit the wrong button of course and ended up messing up my order and having to redo the whole thing.  Not too thrilled with the ipad idea but I moved on.  I sat down and when our drinks were ready, they called my name to go get them.  They had a tip jar on the counter.  I have an issue with this since I had to place my own order and then go get my own drink.  I'm not sure what they did extra that constitutes a tip?  The milk tea was delicious!  The kids loved their drinks and \"pop tarts.\"  I started glancing at some of the books laying on the table and the first one I picked up was on tattoos and had a few nude people inside.  I pushed that one aside to be sure the kids didn't pick it up.  I went to use the restroom and framed on the hall wall was a picture with the F-word all over it.  Hmm, not my idea of tasteful art.  I was glad my children didn't need to use the bathroom.  While my milk tea was good, I wouldn't go back.  It was very expensive for what you get and I'd have to blindfold the children.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        0.000525\n",

But, will probably be back just to be somewhere unique and nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0.000525\n",
